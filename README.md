# Matching-J-s

Not completed but this was my first biggest project that I did & I enjoyed creating this. I really like Jordan's so I just decided that it would be what I end up matching. The hardest part about developing this was getting the images to appear when the square was tapped and now it's trying to get each image to come up only two at a time and if they aren't the same turn back over. Soon I will apply it & upload it on the app store because that's all I need to do to it.
